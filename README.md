Crystal collector game - At the start of the game you will be given random number as a goal. Each of the colored crystals on the page will also be given a random value but you will not know what that value is until after they are clicked. Each time you click a crystal it increases your current score by the crystals value. Your objective is to match your current number to the goal number without going over. 

Each game is a new challenge as the values for your goals and crystals all switch every time you play.
